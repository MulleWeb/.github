MulleWeb is a small Web library collection written on top of the [MulleFoundation](//github.com/MulleFoundation).

It contains amongst other functionality a HTTP server and a HTTP client library and support for JSON. It is experimental at
this stage. Everything taken together should enable your to write a [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) clone fairly quickly.

[MulleScion](//github.com/MulleWeb/MulleScion) is a template engine system like [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) 
for Objective-C, that can be seamlessly embedded into HTML. 

See [mulle-web-developer](//github.com/MulleWeb/mulle-web-developer) for install instructions.

The [mulle-scion wiki](//github.com/MulleWeb/mulle-scion/wiki) contains the documentation, that
is a copy of what is served by mulle-scion.
